This library provides a basic Markov chain-ish object.
It supports both text chaining and integer chaining in vectors.

see Demo.cpp for the basic usage.

The library is very compact and is based on the Chain template found in Markovpp.h.
see Markovpp.h to see examples on creating your own Chain derived classes.
